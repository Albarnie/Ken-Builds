Here are some frequently asked questions about this repository:

# What is this?
This is the official source for alpha/demo builds of ken.

# What is Ken?
Ken is a 2D, story based sidescrolling shooter, in which a doctored epidemic causes you to have to fight your way through hordes of infected individuals untill you can find all your friends, and/or leave.

# Why GitHub?
I use github to publish my builds at this stage because I need to be able to publish builds really often, and easily, because a lot of changes happen really rapidly, and I need an easy way for playtesters to access the newest builds oof my game.

# Where can I see more about the game?
You can join my discord server at discord.gg/ns36x3P, where I post regular updates about this game, and (in the future) any other games I make.

# Is there a Youtube channel?
Yes. every now and then, I post updates on Ken, and cool ideas I have. you can see my channel at youtube.com/channel/UCQmwOdqBz9A9xOzE1P74hTw.

# When will Ken release?
I'm not sure. For Ken, I'm planning on taking my time on this one, as tight deadlines often make sloppy games. In a while, I'll probably release it on Steam, but untill then, keep up to date at my discord server (above).

# Why is it called Ken?
Ken is the main character. When I first started the game, I used the name of the main character to easily identify the game when I talked about it to others. The name is too stuck to it now, even though it's kind of crap, and doesnt make sense to new viewers.

# I have another question /I want to talk to you /I'm lonely and have no friends /I want to playtest!
You can join my discord server for any of the above, at the link above.
